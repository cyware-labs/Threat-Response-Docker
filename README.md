# Introduction

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) has become an important concept in the rapidly evolving cyber threat landscape. With organizations continuously facing complex and malicious cyber threats, CTI gets used widely to counter the rise of cyberattacks. There are many tools and standards proposed and underdevelopment in CTI. While some of them overlap with each other, many of them were used for a specific objective. As a result, an organization ends up combining more than one tool and standards in their CTI program to make it fit with their specific requirement.

CTI tools have grown exponentially over the last decade. But there has been no way to aggregate all these tools into a singular, lightweight platform that is easy to set up, requirement friendly, and scalable.

Cyware&#39;s Threat Response Docker provides a solution by solving what is required. It contains a collection of top-notch tools revolving around automation focused on automating the threat intelligence lifecycle.

# Threat Intelligence Life Cycle

Threat Intelligence often follows a series of steps that can be referred to as its lifecycle [originally developed by the CIA] which often helps security analysts to efficiently analyze and investigate threats. The threat response docker is mapped to this Threat Intelligence Lifecycle with categories mapped to the different phases.

The various phases of the Threat Intelligence Lifecycle are:

**Direction and Planning:** In this phase, the user/ organization/ enterprise defines objectives and plans for collecting and analyzing threat intelligence.

**Collection:** After defining objectives, we begin the process of collecting the intelligence data. We can either collect this data from internal sources, open-source feeds or proprietary feeds from companies such as Kaspersky, FireEye, Alienvault, etc. This is the data that the security analyst will analyze and act upon.

**Processing:** Not all data collected would be of the same format or machine ingestible. In this phase, we convert all data that is received into a standard, machine ingestible format for easier use.

**Analysis and production:** After collecting and processing this data, we further move on to analyze and act on this information. The above said analysis may include but is not limited to indicator validation, indicator enrichment, indicator de duplication, indicator verification, and indicator actioning.

**Dissemination:** After analyzing various threats and indicators, organizations can share this information with other companies for the benefit of the community.

**Feedback:** After completing the above life cycle, the organization reflects on performed actions and reaffirms/ modify procedures implemented.

# Tool Categories in the Cyware Threat Response Docker

The tools in the threat response docker are categorized into 5 important categories based on their role in the Threat Intelligence Lifecycle.

**Collect:** This category relates to the collection phase of the threat intelligence lifecycle and is aimed at providing a method to connect and collect intelligence data from various sources, both open source and freemium.

**Extract:** This category relates to the processing phase of the threat intelligence lifecycle, where we take data collected such as reports, indicators, etc, and extract and standardize them into ingestible formats.

**Analyze:** This category relates to the analysis phase of the threat intelligence lifecycle, providing tools and methods to analyze the above collected and standardized indicators.

**OSINT:** This category of tools provides analysts with further investigative capabilities by allowing them to analyze data using open source intelligence tools and techniques.

**STIX:** This category relates to the dissemination stage of the intelligence lifecycle, allowing an analyst to create, modify, standardize, and share intelligence via STIX objects. Further reference to STIX can be found [here](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/cs01/stix-v2.1-cs01.html).

# Docker Installation

## Supported Operating Systems

- Windows
- MAC
- Linux

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required for successful installation and functioning of the Docker application.

- Storage Required: 2.5 GB
- Storage Recommended: 2.5 GB

## Docker Installation Procedure

We recommend to download the latest version of Docker as it stays updated with the latest features and security patches. The installation package can be downloaded from the below link.

[https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

## Cyware Threat Response Docker Installation Procedure?

You can either run the build.sh file to automatically fetch the image for you or follow the steps below

1. docker run -dit --name trd -p 8081:80 cylabs/cy-threat-response
2. docker exec -it trd bash

**Note:** This docker exposes port 8081 as a HTTP server for allowing easy transfer of files from inside the docker to outside. Do note that this is 1 way and does not allow data transfer from outside the docker to inside.
